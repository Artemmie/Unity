  storyText: 'You are awaken in the dark room, everything seems to be broken. You
    don''t remember who you are, nor how you ended up here. After lurking around
    you finally found a way out of the room. As you were about to leave you noticed
    a group of people standing outside, some of them are heavily armed with weird
    looking firearms. You noticed a patch that looks like a steam on their shoulders.


    What
    shall you do?

    1. Call for help.

    2. Try to sneak out quietly.
